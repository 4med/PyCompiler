# Chaquopy Python Compiler App
This is an example of an interactive Python output script running in an Android app using Chaquopy. Some starting points:

* The example Python script is in 
  [`app/src/main/python/main.py`](https://github.com/4med/PyCompiler/blob/master/app/src/main/python/main.py).
  You can replace this with your own code.
* The Android activity which hosts it is in 
  [`app/src/main/java/com/chaquo/python/console/MainActivity.java`](https://github.com/4med/PyCompiler/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/chaquo/python/console/OutputActivity.java).
* The Chaquopy configuration is in 
  [`app/build.gradle`](https://github.com/4med/PyCompiler/blob/master/app/build.gradle).
